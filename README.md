# FractApp



### Your aims or motivations for selecting the given topic for your project. That is, why did you choose to develop this particular project, and why is this (at least potentially) a useful or interesting project?

I selected this particular project because of its potential ability to positively effect the mental state of the user. I have seen while reasearching this particular topic that the creations that come from the Fractals help the user with anxiety and with relaxing the mind and body.  

But most of all this application will function at its core as a peaceful calming application.

### A “functional inventory” for that repository—i.e. what functional components of the overall project are implemented by code in that repository?

  Currently the application in it's Alpha stage is mostly cosmetic but does show several locations and an included fractal image to show a sample image. 
- A login screen powered by Google Sign In [Google Sign In](https://github.com/googlesamples/google-services/tree/master/android/signin)
- Several fragments that will evenatually perform certain functions.  

### A description of the current state of completion/readiness of this component, or your project as a whole. This should include a “hit list” of deficiencies: any unimplemented/incomplete elements, and known bugs, that would have to be implemented or corrected for a usable prototype (i.e. one that could be given to a skilled user for testing and feedback), ordered with the most urgent items first.

This project is still in its Alpha phase of testing and deployment. While features are able to be viewed and the buttons and imnage are visually there, it is still unable to generate the fractals. This will be enabled in the beta version and this will include the main functionality package.

My order of priorities:
1. The Application runs algorithms to display a series of shapes of all sizes and color combinations.
2. Implementing the code to generate the fractal image.
3. Making the functionality of the buttons work and do the commans they are supposed to. 

What's the basic functionality of the app? The basic functionality of my Android app will draw multiple types of Fractal designs and allows you to zoom in and out to explore the intricacy of such creations. It has a responsive design with a multi-touch interface to explore intricate shapes and patterns. Also an interaction mode which allows the user to control color gradients and different sorts of textures that can change the display. 

Who would find this app useful or fun, and when would they use it? Anyone can download and use this app and find that it is very entertaining and a great way kill some time. It's entertaining eye catching design will mesmerize the user and capture them into an intricate world of never ending creations conisted of different dhapes and patterns.

Could this app be useful on its own, with no connection to the internet? Yes, although some features would require an internet connection the main purpose and fucntion of this app would not require any type of connection.

What sort of data would this app use or share if it had a connection to the internet? If connected to the internet the app will be able to pull andf share information regarding sharing their creation to a social media platform or downloading the file to a local drive or also saving it within a user profile implemented in the app. 

If this app will consume external data, investigate and list possible internet-based sources for this data.

### A list of platforms (Java versions, Android APIs, OS versions, specific hardware, etc.) on which you’ve tested the submitted version of this component of your project, any hardware/software/orientation restrictions that you’re aware of. (This includes restrictions on device language, orientation, etc.)

#### Devices

Motorola G6 API 26 - On this device it seemed to work functionally okay. The app was able to run and open successfully.

#### Emulators

Nexus 5X API 24 - On this emulator it seemed to work functionally okay. The app was able to run and open successfully.

Samsung SM - G930U- On this emulator it seemed to work functionally okay. The app was able to run and open successfully.

### For client side components, a list of aesthetic/cosmetic (not functional) improvements that you think would improve this component. This list should be ordered, with those that would give the most improvement (in your opinion) listed first.

- Ensuring that this application will run on a variety of devices, more field testing. 
- Improving User Navigability and Understanding from the Beginning to End point.
- Allowing Users to become more hands on and create their own fractal images.
- Improving the App performance on a variety of hardware. 

### A list of functional stretch goals. These should be sorted either with those that would add the most utility at the top, or with those that would be the simplest to implement at the top.

- Improve User Experience
- Have a fully functioning application

### Instructions for Building FractApp

1. Clone the repository into a local Android Studio or preferred IDE project.

2. Open up Application on your IDE and run through emulator or personal Android.

3. Build the device with a minimum of API 24. 

### Instructions for Running FractApp

1. The Google Sign-In Screen will load upon starting the application.

2. After Sign-In, the User will be taken to the main screen which will be the main Fractal display.

3 Once the user is on the main page they have the ability to pinch to zoom the fractal.

4. The user also can use the buttons to change and customize the Fractal display to their liking.

#### Motion

- This will give the user the ability to change the motion of the fractals to provide a more immersive experience. 

#### Light

- This button will allow the user to change the light, such as a more darker or brighter light tone.

#### Texture

- This will give the user the ability to explore different types of textures of the fractal to give more the user the chance to craete more unique creations. 

#### Color

- This feature allows the user to change the color opactity that provides the user with ultimate customizable creations.
